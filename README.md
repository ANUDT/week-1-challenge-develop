### Challenge Types 

The two types of Challenges are the following:

* **On-the-job ticket** or **feature request Challenges** give you starter code in a folder called `Develop`, which you'll modify to complete the Challenge. Odd-numbered modules follow this format.

> **Important**: For assignments with starter code, be sure to copy the contents of the `Develop` folder directly into your repository. Do not include the `Develop` folder itself.

* **Job-seeking coding assessments** or **take-home assignments** don't provide starter code. You'll build these from scratch. Even-numbered modules follow this format.
* 

### Challenge Elements

Challenges adhere to a format that's commonly used by software development teams that use **agile project management** to manage their work. Practicing this will prepare you for the workflows you'll experience as a professional full-stack web developer. 

> **Deep Dive**: To learn more about agile, read this [Wikipedia article on agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development).

Each Challenge contains the following elements:


## User Story

```

SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
